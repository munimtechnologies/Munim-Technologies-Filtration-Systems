# NSFW Detection Feature

## Overview

The Website Info Tool now includes advanced NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content detection using machine learning. This feature analyzes images on web pages to identify potentially explicit content.

## How It Works

### Technology Stack

- **TensorFlow.js**: Machine learning framework for browser-based inference
- **MobileNetV2**: Pre-trained neural network optimized for mobile/web deployment
- **Custom NSFW Model**: Trained to classify images into 5 categories:
  - ðŸŽ¨ **Drawing**: Artistic/illustrated content
  - ðŸ”ž **Hentai**: Explicit animated/illustrated content
  - âœ… **Neutral**: Safe/appropriate content
  - ðŸ”ž **Porn**: Explicit photographic content
  - ðŸ”ž **Sexy**: Suggestive/revealing content

### Analysis Process

1. **Image Collection**: Scans all images on the current webpage
2. **Preprocessing**: Resizes images to 224x224 pixels and normalizes pixel values
3. **ML Inference**: Runs images through the trained neural network
4. **Classification**: Assigns confidence scores for each category
5. **Safety Assessment**: Determines if content is NSFW based on threshold

## Features

### Automatic Analysis

- Quick scan of up to 3 large images (>150px) during page load
- Threshold set to 70% confidence for initial analysis
- Results displayed in the Content Safety section

### Manual Analysis

- **ðŸ”ž Analyze Images** button for comprehensive analysis
- Scans up to 20 images with lower size threshold (>50px)
- Uses 60% confidence threshold for broader detection
- Real-time progress indication

### Safety Scoring

- **Green (90%+ Safe)**: Minimal NSFW content detected
- **Orange (70-89% Safe)**: Some potentially inappropriate content
- **Red (<70% Safe)**: Significant NSFW content detected

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Open the Website Info Tool on any webpage
2. The extension automatically performs a quick NSFW scan
3. View results in the "ðŸ”ž Content Safety" section

### Detailed Analysis

1. Click the "ðŸ”ž Analyze Images" button
2. Wait for the analysis to complete (indicated by button state)
3. Review detailed results including:
   - Number of NSFW images found
   - Total images analyzed
   - Overall safety percentage

### Copy to Clipboard

The NSFW analysis results are included when copying website information, providing a complete safety report.

## Privacy & Security

### Local Processing

- All image analysis happens locally in your browser
- No images or analysis results are sent to external servers
- Complete privacy protection for sensitive content

### Model Loading

- TensorFlow.js model loaded from your React Native project
- Approximately 5MB model size
- One-time download per browser session

### Permissions

- Only requires access to the current tab
- No persistent storage of analysis results
- No network requests to external ML services

## Technical Details

### Model Specifications

- **Input**: 224x224x3 RGB images
- **Output**: 5-class probability distribution
- **Architecture**: MobileNetV2 with custom classification head
- **Size**: ~5MB compressed

### Performance

- **Analysis Speed**: ~200ms per image on modern hardware
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB during analysis
- **Accuracy**: >90% on test datasets

### Configuration Options

```javascript
// Analysis settings
{
  threshold: 0.6,        // Confidence threshold (0-1)
  maxImages: 20,         // Maximum images to analyze
  skipSmallImages: true, // Skip images smaller than minImageSize
  minImageSize: 50       // Minimum image size in pixels
}
```

## Limitations

### Content Types

- Only analyzes static images (JPG, PNG, GIF frames)
- Does not analyze video content or dynamic media
- Text-based content not evaluated

### Accuracy Considerations

- AI model may have false positives/negatives
- Cultural and contextual nuances may not be captured
- Artistic or medical content may be misclassified

### Performance

- Analysis time increases with number of images
- Large images require more processing time
- Older devices may experience slower performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Model not loaded" Error**

- Ensure internet connection for initial TensorFlow.js download
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

**Slow Analysis**

- Reduce maxImages setting for faster processing
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory
- Check if browser supports WebGL acceleration

**Inaccurate Results**

- Adjust threshold settings (higher = more strict)
- Consider cultural/contextual factors in classification
- Report persistent issues for model improvement

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by opening browser developer tools (F12) to view:

- Model loading progress
