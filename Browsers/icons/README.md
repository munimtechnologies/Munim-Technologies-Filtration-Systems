# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

## Required Icon Sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows computers)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store and installation)

## Icon Guidelines:

- Use PNG format for best compatibility
- Keep designs simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use consistent styling across all sizes
- Consider transparency for better integration
- Icon should represent the extension's function (e.g., magnifying glass, info symbol, etc.)

## Temporary Solution:

If you don't have custom icons ready, you can:

1. Use online icon generators or free icon websites
2. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
3. Use emoji-to-PNG converters for quick icons

## Suggested Design:

A magnifying glass (üîç) or information symbol (‚ÑπÔ∏è) would work well for this Website Info Tool extension.
